## Week Progress


** Week 1 **

This week we worked on the design of the website, from the landing in its different versions as well as in the different views and functionalities.

The main tool that was used for the design of the page was figma.

#
** Week 2 **

This week the design made in week 1 was passed to code. HTML was worked on following the given specifications and respecting the semantics.

#

** Week 3 ** 

This week we work on CSS to start styling the page.

To shape the page, we worked with attributes such as "position" and "float" which helped to position the different elements in their corresponding places and then use the other attributes to style the page.

It can be seen that the semantics of HTML are now taking shape, this allows us to see in detail the functionalities that the website offers us, from social media icons and informative text to linkable buttons.
#

** Week 4 **

This week the challenge was to be able to make the landing page responsive and to be able to see the content in both the mobile and tablet versions based on the designs made in week 1.

CSS was mainly used, but structural changes were made to the HTML because flexbox had to be used to design the page.

** week-06 **

In week-06 we are going to work giving interaction to the page using JavaScript, we will start with the login section and then the sign-up section where we will create the corresponding .html, .css and .js files where we will create the views according to the screenflow of the week-01. Once the login and sign-up forms have been created, the data must be validated only with js code.

** week-07 **


In week-07 we worked on the week-06 forms so that when pressing the confirmation buttons the data loaded in them is sent to a web server through an HTTP request from JavaScript. We worked with the .fetch method making requests to the server and we also learned the basic concepts of a "query-params", "localStorage" and what was an "API".
