## Week Progress


** Week 3 ** 

This week we work on CSS to start styling the page.

To shape the page, we worked with attributes such as "position" and "float" which helped to position the different elements in their corresponding places and then use the other attributes to style the page.

It can be seen that the semantics of HTML are now taking shape, this allows us to see in detail the functionalities that the website offers us, from social media icons and informative text to linkable buttons.
